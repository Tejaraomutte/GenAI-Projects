Whether in educational \\ninstitutions, office spaces, hospitals, or public areas, excessive noise levels can lead to \\nstress, reduced efficiency, and even long-term health issues. Traditional methods of \\nmonitoring noise pollution rely on manual observation and periodic measurements, \\nwhich are inefficient and fail to provide real-time data for immediate action. To address \\nthis challenge, this project introduces an automated noise monitoring system utilizing \\nIoT technology and cloud-based data processing. By integrating advanced \\nmicrocontroller technology with cloud services, this system enables continuous noise \\nlevel monitoring and automated alerts whenever predefined thresholds are exceeded. \\nThis approach ensures better control over noise pollution in sensitive environments, \\nmaking it easier for authorities to take timely action. \\n   \\nThe core of this project is built around the ESP32 microcontroller, a powerful \\nand cost-effective device with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities. Equipped with \\na high-sensitivity microphone sensor, the ESP32 collects real-time sound data from the \\nsurrounding environment. This data is processed and transmitted securely to AWS IoT \\nCore, where it is further analyzed for noise level fluctuations. When noise levels exceed \\na specified threshold, AWS Lambda processes the incoming data and triggers Amazon \\nSimple Notification Service (SNS) to send alerts via email or SMS.

Classrooms and lecture halls are \\noften affected by unwanted noise, which disrupts student concentration and reduces \\nteaching effectiveness. By deploying this noise monitoring solution in educational \\nsettings, school administrators and faculty members can receive instant alerts when \\nnoise levels become disruptive, allowing them to take necessary actions to maintain a \\nconducive learning environment. Similarly, libraries and study areas can benefit from \\nsuch monitoring, ensuring that students can work in a quiet and focused atmosphere. \\nThe implementation of such a system reflects the increasing need for smart technology \\nsolutions in education, improving both student engagement and overall academic \\nperformance. \\n   \\nThe Fig 1.1 illustrates noise levels in decibels (dB) and their impact on human \\nhearing. It categorizes sound intensity from soft and safe levels, like normal breathing \\n(10 dB), to dangerously loud noises, such as fireworks (140 dB). Understanding these \\nlevels is crucial for monitoring and managing noise pollution in various \\nenvironments.Beyond educational settings, this noise monitoring system has broad \\napplications in workplaces and office environments where excessive noise can hinder \\nproductivity. Open-plan offices, call centers, and collaborative workspaces often \\nexperience noise disturbances that affect employee efficiency and communication. \\nImplementing an automated noise detection and alert system helps maintain a balanced \\nacoustic environment, promoting a more productive and comfortable workspace. \\nMoreover, industries and factories with strict occupational health and safety regulations \\ncan utilize this system to monitor noise exposure levels for workers. By continuously \\ntracking noise levels, organizations can ensure compliance with safety standards and \\ntake preventive measures to protect employees from noise-induced health \\nrisks.Healthcare facilities, particularly hospitals and clinics, require a quiet environment \\nto provide optimal patient care. High noise levels in hospitals have been linked to \\nincreased stress among patients and medical staff, negatively impacting recovery times \\nand decision-making. A noise monitoring system can help hospital administrators \\nidentify areas with excessive noise and implement measures to minimize disturbances. \\nFor instance, in intensive care units (ICUs), maternity wards, and recovery rooms, \\nmaintaining low noise levels is essential for patient comfort and well-being. By \\nleveraging cloud-based noise monitoring, hospitals can enforce noise control policies \\nmore effectively, ultimately enhancing the quality of healthcare services. \\n  \\nIn urban settings, noise pollution is a growing concern due to traffic,'),\n",

Multiple GND (ground) pins \\nare available to provide a common ground reference for all components in the circuit. \\nThese power and ground connections are essential for maintaining circuit stability and \\nensuring proper voltage levels for peripherals connected to the ESP32. \\nb) General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) Pins \\n  \\nThe ESP32 features 34 GPIO pins, which can be used for both input and output \\noperations. These GPIOs allow the ESP32 to interact with sensors, actuators, and other \\nexternal devices. Some GPIOs have special functionalities, such as supporting Pulse \\nWidth Modulation (PWM), Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC), and various \\ncommunication protocols like SPI, I2C, and UART. However, some pins are restricted \\nduring boot-up or when Wi-Fi is active, so developers must carefully select GPIOs based \\non their project requirements. GPIOs can be programmed as digital inputs to read signals \\nfrom buttons or sensors, or as digital outputs to control LEDs, relays, and motors. \\nc) Analog Input Pins (ADC - Analog-to-Digital Converter) \\n  \\nThe ESP32 has a 12-bit ADC resolution, allowing it to convert analog signals \\ninto digital values with a range from 0 to 4095 levels. This feature is particularly useful \\nfor reading sensor data such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and voltage levels. \\nThe ADC is divided into ADC1 and ADC2. While ADC1 (GPIOs 32 to 39) can be used \\nfreely for analog input, ADC2 (GPIOs 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 25-27) is shared with the Wi-Fi \\nmodule, meaning that it cannot be used when Wi-Fi is enabled. Because of this \\nlimitation, it is recommended to use ADC1 pins for analog sensing applications in \\nprojects that require simultaneous Wi-Fi communication. \\nd) Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) Pins \\n  \\nThe ESP32 features two DAC channels that allow the conversion of digital \\nsignals into analog voltages. These DAC pins, DAC1 (GPIO 25) and DAC2 (GPIO 26), \\nare useful in applications that require the generation of analog signals, such as audio \\nwaveform generation, sound synthesis, and voltage-controlled devices. The 8-bit DAC \\nresolution provides a smooth analog output, making it suitable for audio applications, \\nsignal modulation, and power control systems. Unlike PWM, which creates an analog-\\nlike signal using rapid on/off switching, the DAC provides a true analog voltage output, \\nmaking it preferable for applications requiring precise voltage control. \\ne) Touch Sensor Pins \\n  \\nThe ESP32 includes capacitive touch sensors, allowing it to detect touch-based'),\n",

These touch-sensitive GPIOs can \\nmeasure small changes in capacitance when touched by a finger or conductive object. \\nThe ESP32 supports up to 10 touch-sensitive GPIOs (Touch0 to Touch9, mapped to \\nGPIOs 0, 2, 4, 12-15, 27, 32, and 33). This feature is commonly used in applications \\nsuch as gesture-based control panels, interactive devices, and smart touch-switches. The \\nbuilt-in capacitive sensing feature helps reduce external hardware requirements, \\nsimplifying the design of user-friendly interfaces. \\nf) Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Pins \\n  \\nPulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used to control the power \\nsupplied to electronic devices by varying the duty cycle of a signal. The ESP32 has a \\nhighly flexible PWM implementation, as any GPIO pin can be configured as a PWM \\noutput. This allows precise control over LED brightness, motor speed, and audio signal \\ngeneration. The ESP32 supports high-frequency PWM with up to 16-bit resolution, \\nmaking it useful for fine-tuned power adjustments in industrial automation, robotics, \\nand home automation projects. \\ng) Serial Communication Pins \\n  \\n The ESP32 provides multiple options for serial communication, allowing it to \\ninterface with other microcontrollers, sensors, and external modules. It supports UART \\n(Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter), SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface), and \\nI2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocols. UART0 (GPIO 1 for TX and GPIO 3 for RX) \\nis mainly used for debugging and programming, while UART1 and UART2 can be used \\nfor connecting serial devices such as GPS modules, GSM modems, and RFID readers. \\nSPI communication (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, and CS on GPIOs 23, 19, 18, and 5) is used \\nfor high-speed data exchange with devices such as SD cards, displays, and memory \\nmodules. The I2C interface (SDA - GPIO 21 and SCL - GPIO 22) allows easy \\ncommunication with multiple sensors and peripheral modules, making it widely used in \\nIoT applications. \\nh) Interrupt Pins \\n  \\nInterrupts allow the ESP32 to respond immediately to external events, such as \\nbutton presses or sensor triggers. Almost all GPIO pins support interrupts, making it \\neasy to configure event-driven tasks in low-power applications. Interrupts can be set to \\ntrigger on rising, falling, or both edges of an input signal, enabling efficient power \\nmanagement and quick response to sensor inputs. In battery-powered applications, \\ninterrupts are often used to wake up the ESP32 from sleep mode only when necessary, \\nreducing unnecessary energy consumption.'),\n",
